# Simple-Processor

The above is a simple processor implemented in Verilog HDL using Behavioral Modelling. 
This processor implements 4 separate operations:
   1. Input one byte of data (IN)
   2. Output one byte of data (OUT)
   3. Copy one byte of data from one register to another (MOV X, Y)
   4. Add data in a register to accumulator register A (ADD X) 

The instructions were provided in binary (machine-readable) format using a separate Test Bench file.
